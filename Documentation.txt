Django:
 - Installation: `pip install django`
 - Set up in "./django using": `django-admin startproject pong_backend`
 - then in "./django/pong_backend": `python manage.py startapp game`
 - Database configuration (for PostgreSQL) was done in "settings.py"

Django is set up to use a stateless Token-based Authentication system.

Makefile:
 - up: builds images, starts postgres container, makes migrations and then starts django/frontend containers
        django needs postgres to be running to make migrations (essentially setting up the database schema)
